  the Geeklist #hack4good against climate change\, learn all about Geospatia
 l Mapping and Visualisation and see some amazing real-world examples with A
 PI partners CartoDB.\n\nCartoDB is a cloud-based platform to visualize\, an
 alyze\, and develop your geospatial applications. From the CartoDB Editor (
 a browser-based editor to create your data-based maps) to the CartoDB Platf
 orm (a set of APIs to manipulate your data and integrate your maps anywhere
 ) with CartoDB you get the most efficient way to map your data for the web 
 and mobile. \n\nCartoDB came to life after the development of several biodi
 versity and conservation data visualization projects. We couldn’t find any 
 tools that were able to map complex data (think millions of points) in real
  time in a visually attractive way\, so we used different open source proje
 cts and began building our own solution. We were pleased with the results a
 nd thought that maybe others would also be interested in the technology. Ca
 rtodb.com launched more than two years ago\, and since then more than 500 c
 ustomers and thousands of users have signed up in more than 50 countries. \
 n\nOne of the secrets of CartoDB is the power of the PostGIS database backe
 nd. This means you have a complete SQL datastore: you can work with your da
 ta in the way you already know how to. On top of this you have the ability 
 to use geospatial extensions\, which will let you do some crazy geospatial 
 queries and work with your geospatial data just by doing SQL queries.\n\nCa
 rtoDB is the perfect tool to create rapid prototypes: our APIs are simple a
 nd well documented\, so you can start playing\, testing\, and building your
  apps immediately. It’s the perfect companion to any hackathon \;)

  3 billion people — about half of the world's population — live within 200 
 kilometers of a coastline. By 2025\, that figure is likely to double.\n\nWe
 're already seeing the impact of extreme water and increased frequency and 
 intensity of extreme weather events such as tropical storms\, hurricanes\, 
 typhoons and flooding in many parts of the world.\n\nLet's hack solutions t
 o help people\, communities and governments worldwide understand and adapt 
 to these changes and often devastating events.\n\nThe first idea from King 
 Tides is already up - Citizen Science photo & data collection tool - and in
  the coming days we'll be adding more problem statements including NOAA's C

  are rising and oceans are becoming warmer. Longer\, more intense droughts 
 threaten crops\, wildlife and freshwater supplies. From polar bears in the 
 Arctic to marine turtles off the coast of Africa\, our planet’s diversity o

 geeklist-hack4good-heartoday-and-ihcc\n\nIHCC.org.uk (Ian Hutchinson Clinic

 cheon who was passionate about helping young people to reach their full pot
 ential in life. Our programme of prevention and early intervention of heari
 ng loss\, will give underprivileged children this opportunity and ensure th
 at Ian's legacy lives on.\n\nA good example of what they do is the team out
  in Uganda at the moment setting up an audiology clinic:  http://ihcc.org.u
 k/latest/stories/peggys-blog.php\n\nHearToday.org (Hear Today - A Better To
 morrow) - @HearTodayOrg\n\nIs a startup social enterprise currently in Beth
 nal Green Ventures\, London. We are working on tech for hearing impaired ch
 ildren to improve their access to education for children with mild to moder
 ate hearing loss (Typically 1.5% to 2.5% of children). Particularly in the 
 first years of education to prevent them falling behind with their literacy
  skills.\n\nWe work with a lot of charities involved with equal access to e
 ducation and hearing loss\, like IHCC\, Sound-Seekers\, EducAid\, UNICEF et
 c.\n\n**IDEA: Micro-Volunteering Game for subtitling educational videos**\n
 \nWe are developing a low cost 'walkman' size mini-computer that would scre
 en the whole class at the beginning of the year to identify any children wi
 th hearing problems\, who until being diagnosed\, may have been considered 
 as unattentive or slower than their peers.\n\nThe same device could then be
  used as a 'hearing aid' to help that child better understand the teacher d
 uring lessons. \n\nWe would also provide advice and guidance for teachers o
 n how to help children with hearing loss\, and hopefully make the teachers 
 more confident that they really can effectively benefit these children.\n\n
 The features of the HearToday device include:\n\n- it will not need profess
 ional medical training to operate\n- It will be made from consumer electron
 ic components (so it can be maintained locally without expensive proprietar
 y spare parts)\n- The class screening results and individual child's usage 
 data is stored on the device and transmitted by SMS for remote monitoring b
 y specialists\n- We are aiming at a target price of <$100 per unit. \n\nhtt
